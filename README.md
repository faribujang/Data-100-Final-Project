# Data-100-Final-Project
Final project for Data 100 at UC Berkeley, using the "Traffic" datasets

Project Description:

The project will be split up into two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. We will be releasing Part 1 today and Part 2 at a later date, around Thanksgiving break.

 

There are three different datasets you can choose from. You will be asked to perform a series of guided analyses to familiarize yourself with the data, and then you will be asked to propose some of your own explorations to be conducted later. That will be done in Part 2, along with some additional questions.

 

While the three projects are structured very similarly, there are inevitable variations within each dataset that may make certain tasks easier or more difficult on any one of them. We don't want any of you to worry about picking "the hard one." You should choose the dataset that your team finds the most interesting to explore, other considerations aside. We will curve the final results separately within the teams that pick each dataset, and adjust all three grade distributions to reasonably match (mean and variance, modulo not producing grades outside [0, 100]).
